LEFT OUTER JOIN "Orders" AS ord ON cr.id = ord."courierId"
WHERE ord."inDelivery" = TRUE
       OR ord."inDelivery" IS NULL

ORDER BY COUNT(ord.track);


Если необходимо исключить дубликаты заказов:
SELECT cr.login, COUNT(*) as number_of_orders 
FROM 
	(SELECT DISTINCT track, "courierId" as id 
		FROM "Orders" WHERE "inDelivery" = TRUE) as ord 
LEFT OUTER JOIN "Couriers" as cr 
	ON cr.id = ord.id 
GROUP BY cr.login;
